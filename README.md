# liri-app

This is a Node.js command line interface (CLI) app that allows users to search the APIs of SeatGeek, Spotify, and Open Movie Database (omdb) with the help of the packages of node-spotify-api and axios. Secret keys are stored outside of the source code with the help of the dotenv package. The package moment helped with formatting dates. This app was created to satisfy the requirements of Unit-09-nodejs of the Georgia Institute of Technology software development professional program in the Fall of 2019.

## Getting Started

In order for this application to run on your local computer, you must have Node.js installed as well as the required node modules. 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

>install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/

> install npm packages

```shell
$ npm install
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
